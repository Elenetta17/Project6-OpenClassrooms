# Project6-OpenClassrooms
Classify consumer goods
## Business case
The company "Place de marché" wants to launch an e-commerce marketplace. On the marketplace, sellers offer items to buyers by posting a photo and a description. For now, the item’s categorization is done manually by sellers, and is therefore unreliable, and the volume of items is currently very small.
To improve the user experience for sellers (facilitate the posting of new items) and buyers (facilitate the search), and with a view to scaling up, it becomes necessary to automate this task.
